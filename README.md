# coefficient-of-determination
This is a Python solution that uses a Linear Regression model to make predictions on a simple dataset, and calculate the coefficient of determination against the predictions from the provided values.  

This exercise uses the following dataset sourced from Devzohaib on Kaggle, https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/devzohaib/tvmarketingcsv
This dataset provides "Sales" information based on the respective "TV" marketing budget.

The specific coding challenge question from Coderbyte utilized a different dataset. The specific ask was: 

*In the Python file, write a script that will perfom a linear regression on the data in data.txt and then calculate the coefficient of determination of the prediction.*
