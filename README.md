# coefficient-of-determination
This is a Python solution that uses a Linear Regression model to make predictions on a simple dataset, and calculate the coefficient of determination against the predictions from the provided values.  

This exercise uses the following dataset sourced from Vipul L Rathod on Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vipullrathod/fish-market

The fish market dataset is a collection of data related to various species of fish and their characteristics. This dataset is designed for polynomial regression analysis and contains several columns with specific information. More information on the content of this dataset could be found in the Kaggle link.

The specific coding challenge question from Coderbyte utilized a different dataset. The specific ask was: 

*In the Python file, write a script that will perfom a linear regression on the data in data.txt and then calculate the coefficient of determination of the prediction.*
